Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Bugs / Feature Requests

We welcome you to use this repository's [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/operatehappy/packer-hashicorp/issues) to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open and recently closed issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue.

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the `main` branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the change already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.
